College Enquiry Chatbot System 🤖
Overview
Welcome to the College Enquiry Chatbot System! This project is a conversational AI chatbot designed to answer common queries related to a college's offerings, events, admissions, and more. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning, this chatbot aims to provide instant responses, enhancing user experience and making information accessible 24/7.

Features ✨
Interactive and User-Friendly: Engage in a smooth conversation with the chatbot to get quick answers to your queries.
NLP-based Understanding: Utilizes tokenization, lemmatization, and a neural network to understand user inputs effectively.
Customizable Responses: Easily update responses and intents based on changing needs or requirements.
Scalable Model: A trained neural network model that can be improved further with more data and training.
Tech Stack 🛠️
Python: Core programming language for the entire project.
TensorFlow/Keras: Used for building and training the neural network model.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text preprocessing including tokenization and lemmatization.
NumPy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
JSON: For storing intents and chatbot responses.
Pickle: For saving and loading preprocessed data (words and classes).

How It Works 🧠
Data Preparation:

The chatbot uses an intents.json file that contains different user intents, including patterns (possible user inputs) and corresponding responses.
The data is preprocessed using tokenization and lemmatization to convert text into a structured format.
Model Training:

Using the processed data, a neural network model is built with TensorFlow/Keras.
The model is trained to predict the appropriate intent based on the user's input.
Response Generation:

When a user sends a message, it is tokenized and converted into a bag-of-words vector.
The trained model predicts the user's intent, and a corresponding response is chosen randomly from the predefined responses.
Getting Started 🚀
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
TensorFlow
NLTK
NumPy
Install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
Train the Model (if not already trained):

bash
Copy code
python chatbot_train.py
This will preprocess the data and train the model, saving it as chatbotmodel.h5.

Start the Chatbot:

bash
Copy code
python chatbot_app.py
Start interacting with your personal college enquiry assistant!

Future Enhancements 🔮
Enhanced NLP: Improve the chatbot's understanding using more advanced NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER).
Database Integration: Integrate with a college database to provide real-time information about courses, events, and admissions.
Voice Assistance: Add voice input and output capabilities for a more interactive experience.
